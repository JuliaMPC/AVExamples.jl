# obstacle_detector with vehicle_description and nloptcontrol_planner
Same as ``system demoB.launch`` except, now obstacle_detector is used to detect the obstacle information and pass it to nloptcontrol_planner.

## status = working

## Expected Output
The only difference between this and ``system demoB.launch`` is that now an ``Rviz`` Display pops up and shows that the obstacle is being detected.
