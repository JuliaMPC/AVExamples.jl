# MAVs Dockerfile workflow:
The workflow is consisted of two part: build and run
For build part:
Pull the base image from c1yxuan/avpg_base
Build Dockerfile: this Dockerfile mainly copy the source files in ros/ into the container and run “catkin_make” to setup ros workspace.
Inside the Dockerfile of c1yxuan/avpg_base:
Pull the base image from nvidia/opengl:runtime
Install essential packages
Install ROS kinetic
Install Julia
Install Chrono
For run part:
Setup PATH variable for later use of volumes when execute docker run.
docker run command to execute mavs image.

What are Volumes? For simplicity, volumes are the mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. Click here for more information.
In run.sh, several volumes are created. For shared_dir/ directory, this one is used to store the demonstration data and we can do some post process after we terminate the container. As for ros/src/ directory, it shares the source files in the local machine with container. It means we can modify the files outside the container and see the instant change inside the container. And this can be used at the scenario that we need to update script file, such as Python, ROS launch file, without rebuild the image.
