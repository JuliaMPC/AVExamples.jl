# MAVs Documentation

## Introduction

This software simulates autonomous vehicles within a ROS environment.


## Installation

### Docker

Change directory to MAVs  

* Build image:  
```
sh build.sh
```
The shell script pull the base image from avpg/cain and then run the Dockerfile to build mavs.  


* Run image:  
```
sh run.sh
```
The shell script runs the image as container with [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) setup. For simplicity, volumes are the mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by containers.  
When using container to run demonstration, you can store the data in MAVs/shared_dir and still be able to access it after closing the container.
Besides, any change in the MAVs/ros/src of local machine will change instantly in the container. That is, you can update lanuch files, parameters files, Python scripts without building image again. However, if you modify cpp files, then you need to rebuild the image to generate the execution files.

* Launch the docker from other terminals:  
```
docker ps -l # Show the latest created container
docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
```


### Local
dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-move-base
```
