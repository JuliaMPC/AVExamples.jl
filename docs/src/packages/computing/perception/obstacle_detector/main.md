# obstacle_detector
This obstacle detector is forked from [obstacle_detector](https://github.com/tysik/obstacle_detector.git)
We made some modifications so that the package can detect and track obstacles from 3D PointCloud. Detected obstacles come in a form of circles. The working principles of the method are described in an article provided in the resources folder.

This obstacle detection algorithms can predict the position `(x,y)`, velocity `(x,y)`, and size (assuming circular obstacles).
