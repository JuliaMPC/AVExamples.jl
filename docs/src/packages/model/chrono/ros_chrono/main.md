# ros_chrono
A HMMWV vehicle model developed in Project `Chrono` is controlled using `ROS` parameters by 4 different modes, which are described below.

## Mode 1: dynamic path following
In this mode, the HMMWV vehicle receives and follows dynamic paths with reference speed. The speed control and steering control are achieved internally using PID controllers.
To run the HMMWV vehicle using this mode, use the ROS node `path_following`.
```
$ rosrun ros_chrono path_following
```

### Input
The input includes the global coordinates of path points and the reference speed obtained from external planners.

Name | Description
--- | ---
`/trajectory/ux`| reference vehicle speed (m/s)
`/trajectory/x`| global x coordinate vector of trajectory points (m)
`/trajectory/y`| global y coordinate vector of trajectory points (m)

### Notes
Currently this node only supports straight paths, but will be updated soon to support interpolation and curved paths.

For more explanation of the usage, please check the demo at the end of this document.

## Mode 2: dynamic steering trajectory following
In Mode 2, this node `steering_controller` can simulate the vehicle’s motion at the control of varying steering input. In this test, both steering and velocity command are hardcoded.

To run the HMMWV vehicle using this mode, use the ROS node ‘steering_controller’.

```
rosrun ros_chrono steering_controller
```

### Input
These steering angles obtained from external planners are used to as an input for the `Chrono` vehicle to follow.

Name | Description
--- | ---
`/trajectory/ux`| longitudinal velocity (m/s)
`/trajectory/sa`| steering angle (rad/s)

### Notes

## Mode 3: dynamic speed trajectory following
In Mode 3, this node `velocity_controller` can simulate the vehicle’s motion at the control of varying velocity. In this test velocity command is hardcoded.

To run the HMMWV vehicle using this mode, use the ROS node ‘velocity_controller’.

```
rosrun ros_chrono velocity_controller
```

### Input
These velocity trajectories obtained from external planners are used to as an input for the `Chrono` vehicle to follow.

Name | Description
--- | ---
`/trajectory/vx`| longitudinal velocity (m/s)

### Notes
Below is the expected output for velocity controller:

## Mode 4: dynamic speed and steering trajectory following
In Mode 4, this node `steering_controller` can simulate the vehicle’s motion at the control of varying velocity and steering input. In this test, both steering and velocity command are hardcoded.

To run the HMMWV vehicle using this mode, use the ROS node ‘steering_controller’.
```
rosrun ros_chrono steering_controller
```

### Input
These velocity and steering angle obtained from external planners are used to generate a path for the `Chrono` vehicle to follow.

Name | Description
--- | ---
`/trajectory/ux`| longitudinal velocity (m/s)
`/trajectory/sa`| local steering angle (rad/s)

### Notes
The node rqt_graph for `steering_controller` is shown below:

## All  Modes
The following output, settings, flags, topics, and parameters apply to all modes.

### Output
The output includes vehicle information stored `State.msg` and sent to the `/state` topic as:
Name | Description
--- | ---
`/state/t`| simulation time (s)
`/state/x`| global vehicle x position (m)
`/state/y`| global vehicle y position (m)
`/state/ux`| vehicle speed in x direction (vehicle frame) (m/s)
`/state/ax`| vehicle acceleration in x (vehicle frame) (m/s^2)
`/state/v`| vehicle speed in y direction (vehicle frame) (m)
`/state/psi`| global yaw angle (rad)
`/state/r`| yaw rate (rad/s)
`/state/sa`| steering angle (rad)

The output includes Chrono control information stored in `Control.msg` and which is sent to the `/control` as topic as:
Name | Description
--- | ---
`/control/t`| simulation time (s)
`/control/throttle`| throttle control input [0, +1]
`/control/brake`| brake control input [0, +1]
`/control/steering`| steering control input (rad)

To view states updating while `Chrono` is running, open a new terminal and enter the container by
```
$ docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
```

`<container_name>` can be auto-filled by the `Tab` key. Then run

To show the states:
```
$ rostopic echo /state
```

This displays all states in the `state.msg` file.

Or:
```
$ rostopic echo /trajectory/chrono
```
This displays all controls in the `controlChrono.msg` file.

## OLD (below this)
A vehicle model in `Chrono` that can be used through `ROS`.

The vehicle model currently runs with rigid tire models, a rear-wheel driveline, double wishbone suspension (reduced so that the control arm positions are distance constraints), and rack and pinion steering.

## To run
```
$ cd $HOME/MAVs/ros
$ roslaunch ros_chrono demo.launch
$ rosparam set system/default/flags/initialized true
```

## Expected Output
![link](images/expectedoutputchronodemo.png)


## To run velocity test
Velocity test shows the ability of chorono to exchange information with ros.
```
$ roslaunch ros_chrono demo_velocity_control.launch
```
## Expected Output
![link](images/demo_velocity_control.png)
=======

## To run steering tracking test
steering tracking test shows the ability of chorono to exchange information with ros.
```
$ cd $HOME/MAVs/ros
$ roslaunch ros_chrono steering.launch
```
## Expected Output
![link](images/demo_steering.png)
Under a constant speed, the vehicle will be controlled by the steering angle command to follow the steering angle trajectory.


## Miscellaneous notes (may be outdated!)
### Change Vehicle Initial Conditions
To change initial trajectory edit the parameters in the `hmmwv_chrono_params.yaml` config file.

```
$ sudo gedit ros/src/system/config/s1.yaml

```
To change target speed, edit:

```
$ sudo gedit ros/src/models/chrono/ros_chrono/config/hmmwv_params.yaml
```
### Change Values of Updated Path
For the path_follower demo, update the parameters of `/state/chrono/default/traj/yVal`, `/state/chrono/default/traj/x` in hmmwv_chrono_params.yaml. Change the system/planner parameter to chrono in chrono.yaml. In general, set system/planner to desired planner and update state/chrono/ <planner_name> /traj/x, vehicle/chrono/ <planner_name> /traj/yVal.
