# mavs_ros_planner

This is a setup for [Navigation Stack](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Using%20rviz%20with%20the%20Navigation%20Stack#Overview) for the HMMWV model. This uses [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) `ROS` package and given a `Start` `Pose` and `Goal` `pose`, it publishes a trajectory into `/cmd_vel`.

The setup uses `navfn/NavfnROS` as `base_global_planner` and `base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS` as `base_local_planner`
